# Deploying on a managed host (Ploi, Uplary, or any VM)

UiDesired is one Laravel application. There is no renderer service, no
container image, and nothing to orchestrate: the dashboard, the API, and every
published customer site are served by the same PHP process.

Full instructions are in [../DEPLOY.md](../DEPLOY.md). This page covers only
what is specific to a managed host.

## Check this first

**PHP 8.4 or newer.** Locked Symfony packages require `>=8.4.1`; on 8.3 the
application fails while loading vendor and never boots. Node is needed to build
the front end during deployment, not to run anything.

## Ploi

1. Create a site, set **PHP 8.4+**, and point the web directory at
   `/public`.
2. Connect the repository and enable deployments.
3. Use `./deploy.sh` from the repository root as the deploy script, or inline
   the same steps: `composer install`, `migrate --force`, `pnpm install &&
   pnpm build`, then the config/route/event caches.
4. Add the daemon and cron entry from DEPLOY.md - one queue worker, and
   `schedule:run` every minute.
5. Add the dashboard hostname, `*.sites.example.com`, and every custom domain
   to the same site, so all of them reach this application.

## Uplary

Uplary clones each release into `releases/<timestamp>` and then runs its own
fixed Laravel pipeline - `composer install`, `artisan migrate`, the caches -
**from the release root**. It never runs `deploy.sh`.

That is why the Laravel application sits at the repository root rather than in
`apps/api`. The stock pipeline finds `composer.json` and `artisan` where it
expects them, and nothing about the deploy needs customising.

Set on the site:

- **PHP 8.4+**. On 8.3 the app fails while loading vendor.
- **Web directory `/public`**.
- **Shared `.env`** at the release root - the same file every release symlinks to.
- **Shared `storage/`**, so uploads and logs survive a release swap.

## The front-end build

Uplary's asset step runs `npm install && npm run build`, but this is a pnpm
workspace: the dashboard depends on `workspace:*` packages that npm cannot
resolve, and `public/dashboard` is gitignored, so a release clone starts with no
dashboard at all.

The root `build` script therefore fetches pnpm through `npx` and runs the
workspace build itself. `npm run build` works unmodified, and no deploy hook is
needed. Two consequences worth knowing:

- The build needs network access to fetch pnpm on first run.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` must stay in step with the root `package.json`, because the
  script installs with `--frozen-lockfile`. If you change a dependency, commit
  the regenerated lockfile with it or the deploy fails with
  `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE`.

## Reference data seeds itself

The pipeline runs `migrate` but never `db:seed`, and a deployment that only
migrates comes up unusable: registration calls `assignFreePlan`, which does
`Plan::where('slug', 'free')->firstOrFail()` and 404s when the table is empty;
the template picker shows nothing; and there is no administrator to sign in as.

`migrate` is the one step every pipeline runs, so the seeding hangs off it -
`AppServiceProvider::seedReferenceDataAfterMigrate` runs `db:seed` when the
migrate command finishes, which brings in the plans, the template catalogue and
the super admin. Nothing to run by hand, and every seeder is keyed on a slug
through `updateOrCreate`, so it is safe over a database that was already
seeded.

It runs on **every** deploy, not only the ones that had a migration pending.
This used to hang off the migration itself, which runs once per database, so a
release that added a template and no migration never reached production - the
catalogue stayed at whatever it held the day the migration first ran. Aperture,
Forma and Kirki were added five days after it, and were the ones that went
missing.

**Set `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` before that
release.** `SuperAdminSeeder` returns without doing anything when either is
missing, silently, and you get no administrator.

A database that fell behind while the seeding was still tied to the migration
catches up on the next deploy, with nothing to run by hand. To pull the
catalogue in without waiting for one:

```bash
cd /var/www/<site>/current && php artisan db:seed --class=TemplateSeeder --force
```

One thing the pipeline still does not do for you:

- **Run a queue worker.** Add the daemon and the `schedule:run` cron from
  DEPLOY.md.

Point the dashboard hostname, `*.sites.example.com`, and every custom domain at
the same site, so all of them reach this application.

## Do not add these files to public/

`robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are routes that answer per site. A static file of
either name in `public/` shadows the route and serves one customer's
content to everybody.
