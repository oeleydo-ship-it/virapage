# Deploying UiDesired

One Laravel application serves everything: the builder dashboard, the API, and
every published customer website. There is no Node process at runtime, no
renderer service, and no Docker. Deployment is a git pull and two build steps.

## What runs on the server

| Piece | How it is served |
| --- | --- |
| Builder dashboard | Static build in `public/dashboard`, served by Laravel on the dashboard hostname |
| API | Laravel, under `/api` |
| Published sites | HTML rendered at publish time, stored in `page_renders`, served by Laravel on the site's own hostname |
| Site runtime | `public/site/site.js` and `public/site/site.css`, loaded by published pages |

Published pages are **not** rendered per request. When someone presses Publish,
the builder renders each page with the same React block components the editor
uses and uploads the HTML. A visitor request is one indexed lookup.

## Requirements

**PHP 8.4 or newer.** `composer.json` says `^8.3`, but seventeen of
the locked Symfony packages require `>=8.4.1` and use syntax that 8.3 cannot
parse. On 8.3 the application does not boot; it fails while loading vendor.

- PHP 8.4+ with these extensions:
  - Required by dependencies: `ctype` `curl` `dom` `fileinfo` `filter` `hash`
    `iconv` `json` `libxml` `mbstring` `openssl` `pcre` `session` `simplexml`
    `tokenizer`
  - Required by the queue worker and Reverb: `pcntl` `posix` (CLI)
  - Required by the app: `pdo_mysql` (or `pdo_sqlite`)
  - Recommended: `gd`. Image resizing is guarded with `function_exists`, so
    uploads still work without it - they are just stored unresized.
- Composer 2
- MySQL 8+ / MariaDB 10.6+ (SQLite is fine for a small install)
- Node 22.12+ (or 20.19+) and pnpm — **build time only**, never at runtime
- Redis optional. On one server the `database` queue and cache drivers are
  fine; Horizon and Reverb are the only parts that want Redis.

## First deploy

```bash
git clone <your-repo> /var/www/uidesired
cd /var/www/uidesired
cp .env.example .env   # then edit it, see below
composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
php artisan key:generate --force
php artisan migrate --force
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
php artisan storage:link
```

`migrate` also seeds the reference data - the plans, the template catalogue
and the super admin - so there is no separate seeding step. It does this on
every run, not just the first, because the catalogue grows with each release
and a deployment that only migrates would otherwise keep the catalogue it was
created with. The seeders are keyed on slugs, so re-running costs a few
seconds and changes nothing that is already correct.

Point the web server's document root at **`public`**. The Laravel application
is the repository root, so a managed host's stock PHP pipeline works with no
configuration beyond that.

## Every deploy after that

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## Environment

The hostnames are what separate the dashboard from customer sites, so these
three matter most:

```
APP_URL=https://app.example.com
FRONTEND_URL=https://app.example.com
PLATFORM_DOMAIN=sites.example.com
```

`APP_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` are the dashboard. **Every other hostname that
reaches the app is treated as a published site** and resolved against the
`domains` table; a hostname with no active row gets a 404. Add extra dashboard
hostnames with `DASHBOARD_HOSTS=a.example.com,b.example.com`.

Point `*.sites.example.com` and every custom domain at this same server.

## Web server

Nginx, with `try_files` so built assets never reach PHP:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app.example.com *.sites.example.com;   # plus custom domains
    root /var/www/uidesired/public;
    index index.php;

    # Hashed dashboard assets can be cached hard; the site runtime has fixed
    # filenames and changes on deploy, so give it a short life instead.
    location /dashboard/assets/ { expires 1y; add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable"; }
    location /site/ { expires 1h; add_header Cache-Control "public"; }

    location / { try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string; }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

Do not add a `robots.txt` or `sitemap.xml` file to `public/` — both are routes
that answer per site, and a static file would shadow them for every customer.

## AI generation needs a patient proxy

Building a whole website is one long request: the model is asked for the design,
then for every page, and nothing is sent to the browser while it writes. A proxy
that gives up on an idle connection after the usual 60 seconds will cut the
stream part-way, and the builder reports that the connection dropped.

Give the AI endpoints longer than the model can take. `AI_TIMEOUT` (default 180)
is what the app allows the provider, so the proxy has to outlast it:

```nginx
location ~ ^/api/v1/ai/ {
    proxy_read_timeout 300s;
    proxy_send_timeout 300s;
    fastcgi_read_timeout 300s;
    # The generation stream is newline-delimited JSON and must not be buffered.
    proxy_buffering off;
    gzip off;
}
```

PHP-FPM needs the same room, or the worker is killed mid-generation:
`request_terminate_timeout = 300` in the pool config.

If a whole-site build still drops while a single page succeeds, the proxy is
almost always the thing to look at first.

## Queue and scheduler

```
* * * * * cd /var/www/uidesired && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

Run one worker, via systemd or Supervisor:

```
php /var/www/uidesired/artisan queue:work --queue=livechat,publishing,domains,media,notifications,analytics,automations,default
```

## Re-rendering published sites

Published HTML is rebuilt when someone presses Publish. After a deploy that
changes block markup, existing sites keep serving the HTML from their last
publish until they are published again. That is intentional: a deploy never
silently changes a customer's live page.
